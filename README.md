## Google Cloud Vision API

The Google Cloud Vision API is a machine learning service that analyzes images to extract information such as objects, faces, text, and scenes. It can also classify images and detect landmarks. The Vision API can be used to build a wide range of applications, such as:

* Image search and classification
* Photo organization and editing
* Content moderation and safety
* Accessibility and assistive technologies
* Medical imaging and diagnostics

## How to use it

To use the Vision API, you will need to:

1. Create a Google Cloud Platform account and enable the Vision API.
2. Install the Vision API client library for your programming language.
3. Create a request to the Vision API, specifying the image you want to analyze and the features you want to extract.
4. Send the request to the Vision API and receive the response.
5. Parse the response to extract the information you need.
